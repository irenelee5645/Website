					<div id="description">
					<p >United States' educational inequality is negatively correlated with economic factor. However, when we look at the data closer, economic status is stratified by racial factor. Even in the same schooll, not only are students of color from lower economic status but also they perform at a much lower rate than their white peers. As such racial aspect is a key factor in current racial educational inequality.</p>

					<p>Racial academic performance gap is evident in math score gap in SAT, one of the most common standardized test. Majority of black and Hispanic students scored in the lower range(300-500), while the other ethnic groups mostly scored in the upper half. The graph on the right shows the trend in the racial SAT math achievement gap. Although the disparity has been decreasing a lot since 2008, there still is a significant performance gap between black and white students. </p>

					<p>Standardized math testing conducted by NAEP also reveals racial performance gap. Underrepresented minoirities, especially black students, scored much lower in NAEP math assessment than other students. The graph on the right shows that race has much greater impact on math assessment than gender. The data implies that racial educational inequality is a much more pressing concern than that of gender.</p>

			<h3>NAEP Reading Test Score Comparison</h3>

				<p>Reading- ages 9 (light gray), 13 (dark gray), and 17 (black)</p>

			<div class="dataDescriptionR" id="description">
				<p>This statistics shows that racial academic performance gap exists not only in math but also in reading. The disparity in reading score is obvious as early as age 9. The overall trend in the reading scores as students get older and time passes is similar across all raical groups. However, there is a significant disparity in the performance levels of white studetns and racial minority students. The average test scores for 17 year old black and Hispanic students are about the same as that of 13 year old white students. Although the test scores of students of color are increasing more than white students', the disparity is still large. </p>
